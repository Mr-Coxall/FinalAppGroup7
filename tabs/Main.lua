-- This program displays an image and let the user move it with their finger

-- Updated on: Oct 2015
-- Updated so you can enter a number to size a button object.1 is 100% normal size. 2.00 would be 200% the size. 0.50 would be 1/2 the size

-- Updated on: Nov 2015
-- Updated so you can "simulate" real Game Center functionality on the iPad
-- Normally you would have to add the Game Center code after you export to Xcode
-- since there is no way to call Game Center in Codea.
-- Now set DEBUG_GAMECENTER = true and alerts will pop up to tell you what is happening.
-- Just before exporting to Xcode, change it to DEBUG_GAMECENTER = false,
-- uncomment the one line of code in Xcode that starts up Game Center and you are good to go.


-- Global variables to the entire project

-- this turns on Game Center simulation from the Helper Class
-- this is so you can call Game Center code within Codea 
-- and just set this boolean to "false" before you export to Xcode
DEBUG_GAMECENTER = true

-- variables local to entire file
local beetle
local planet
local aButton
